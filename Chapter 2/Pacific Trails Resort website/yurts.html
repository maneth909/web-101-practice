      <dt><strong> What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each
        yurt is fuly enclosed with canvas wals, a wooden floor, and a roof dome
        that can be opened.
      </dd>
      <dt><strong> How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and
        gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and
        a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities
        are located in the lodge.

      <dt><strong> What should I bring?</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
        changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to
        bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
